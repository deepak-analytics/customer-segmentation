# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning. We use **KMeans Clustering** to identify patterns in customer behavior based on **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- 100 customers
- Features: `CustomerID`, `Age`, `Annual Income (k$)`, `Spending Score (1-100)`

---

## 📊 Objective
Segment customers into different groups so that the business can:
- Understand customer behavior
- Improve targeted marketing
- Personalize customer experience

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📈 Steps Performed
1. Loaded customer data
2. Visualized spending score vs income
3. Applied **KMeans** with 5 clusters
4. Visualized the customer segments

---

## 🖼️ Output
- 5 distinct customer clusters
- Clear scatter plot showing segmentation
